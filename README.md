# Lambda-rings: Definitions and basic properties

These are notes on the theory of &lambda;-rings.
I started writing them as I was learning the subject myself.
Later I realized that much of the content is explained (usually
better) in
[Yau's *&lambda;-rings* book](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7664)
and in Hazewinkel's
[*Witt vectors* notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3888).
Nevertheless, the notes might be of some marginal use.

## PDF

The PDF can be downloaded from my website:

## Status

Various parts of the notes (special &lambda;-rings, Adams
operations etc.) are more or less completely.
Other subjects (such as symmetric functions and Witt
vectors) have not been breached.
I am not actively working on these notes any longer,
but I do correct mistakes as I become aware of them
(let me know at darijgrinberg@gmail.com if you find one!).

## Topics covered:

* definitions of &lambda;-rings and special &lambda;-rings;

* examples (binomial &lambda;-rings);

* Grothendieck's &Lambda;(K);

* Adams operations (for special and non-special &lambda;-rings;
  however the advanced facts are not being discussed);

* Todd homomorphisms;

* &lambda;-verification principle (not in its strongest form,
  but in a useful enough one).
